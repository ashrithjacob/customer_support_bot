EDUCATION
Technical University, Dortmund
Jul 2019 - Dec 2020
Master's thesis project on "Increasing transverse relaxation (T2) in magnetic resonance imaging"
Designed pulse sequences on Bruker scanners to improve image resolution of MRI images by prolonging the transverse
relaxation by the addition of œÄ refocusing pulses and wrote image processing scripts in MATLAB to create 'noise
masks' to render the MRI image, background noise free
Indian Institute for Science Education and Research, Pune
2015 - 2020
BS-MS dual degree in physics (minor mathematics). Courses included: Statistical mechanics, Non-linear dynamics,
Linear algebra, Quantum mechanics, Graph theory, Cryptography, Data Science, Probability and Statistics
CGPA: 8.9/10
TECHNOLOGY STACK
Machine learning libraries: Pytorch, mlflow, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, XGboost, Langchain
Programming Languages: Python, SQL, Fortran,LATEX, HTML, CSS
Others: FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Docker-Compose, Ansible, AWS(Sagemaker, s3, EC2), Bash, Git, DICOM(Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine)
WORK EXPERIENCE
AI Consultant- Gateway ventures
Dec 2022 - present
NLP: RAG/ Autonomous Agents
Bangalore, India
‚Ä¢ Built a RAG + Knowledge graph pipeline with vision transformer models to extract context from video data
extracted from wearables to serve as a AI personal assistant. Worked with a product manager to align tasks
and objectives and implement design.
‚Ä¢ Worked closely with external clients for chatbot development: Built and hosted a website for customers to
leverage OpenAI's API to summarise and answer questions on larger documents. Sped up large document perusal
for client by 10x(langchain, fastapi, gpt-4). Further Fine-tuned a custom chatbot based on the client's proprietary
data and weblinks, using LLamaIndex for retrieval augmented generation(RAG) to generate a non-hallucinating
response, based on custom corpus of data (tech used: LLamaIndex, gpt4, text embeddings, streamlit).
‚Ä¢ developed an ML pipeline to generate consumer behaviour insight from video data for an ecommerce company
to improve targetted advertisements for the client.
Mediaire Gmbh
Jul 2022 - Nov 2022
ML engineer/ Customer Support
Berlin, Germany
Mediaire is a startup building AI products for MRI such as image segmentations and automated diagnostic reports.
As part of the early team, was involved in support and data roles
‚Ä¢ as part of the ML team helped fine-tune nnunet for knee and prostate data. Fine tuning involved choice of
empirical parameters(3D v 2D v 3D cascade for the specific use case), improving eval metric(dice coefficient) by
7%.
‚Ä¢ Streamlining customer support: creating bug reports, debugging client issues using logs and database queries(sqlite),
developing structured processes in developing workflows for the customer success team.
‚Ä¢ Tested and secured client connections through a bastion server using Ansible, employing infrastructure as code
Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine
Sep 2021 - Mar 2022
Research Intern
Berlin, Germany
MDC is a research institute partnering with industry, dedicated to solving problems in healthcare and biotech- nology
‚Ä¢ Developed data processing pipelines to implement the following: 1. First and Second order phase corrections on
MRI data. 2. Data cleansing to eliminate background noise thus rendering the highest sharpness of images for
ML pipeline(segmentation, detection etc.)
